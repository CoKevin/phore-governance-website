# phore-governance-website
Uses Python3 and Jinja2 to generate a website with informations about the phore network.

Needs a wallet with rpc-interface on the same server.

If you want to put up the website, IÂ recommend using crontab to let it run the python script every minute or so.

If you want to run this website on a masternode server, don't forget to exclude port 80 from the firewall.
